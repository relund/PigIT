This folder contains the optimal policy of the HMDP and the simulated data of three pens with different genetics properties. Pen 2 has a normal growth rate and Pens 1 and 3 grow twenty percent slower and faster than Pen 2. Simulated data for each pen has been stored in the "penDaily" and "penAve" files.

"penDaily" includes daily information related to daily simulation of individual pigs in the pen. Observed data in this file is daily weight and feed intake of individula pigs. In the related pdf file the main fields are:   
t: Day number
pig: Id of an individual pig in the pen. 
FI: Feed intake of an individual pig in the pen.
OLW: Observed live weight of an individual pig in the pen.
culled: A binary value showing that whether a specefic pig has been culled from the pen or not (resulted from the optimal policy of HMDP).
week: Week number. 
pen: Pen number. 
feedMix: The feed-mix number that is currently used in the pen (resulted from the optimal policy of HMDP).

"penAve" contains weekly information in the pen level. Observed weekly weigh and feed intake in the pen level were claculated using the file "penDaily" that are inputs to the GSSM and nGSSM. Estimated mean and standard deviation of weight and growth are the outputs of GSSM and nGSSM. Moreover the optimal decisions of marketing and feeding have been shown. In the related pdf file the main fiels are:       

t: Day number in the pen.
aveOLWALL: The observed averge live weight in the pen level (for an unselected pen).  
sdOLWALL: The observed standard deviation of live weight in the pen level (for an unselected pen).
aveFIAll: The average feed intake in the pen level (for an unselected pen).
alive: Numebr of pigs that has been remained in the pen.
pen: Pen number.
week: Week number. 
stage: Stage number in the HMDP.
eAveOLWALL: Estimated mean of live weight in the pen level (output of GSSM).  
eAveGALL: Estimated mean of growth rate in the pen level (output of GSSM).
eSdOLWALL: Estimated standard deviation of live weight in the pen level (output of nGSSM).
optFeedMix: Optimal feeding decision resulted from the optimal policy of HMDP. 
optThreshold: Optimal marketing decision resulted from the optimal policy of HMDP.
